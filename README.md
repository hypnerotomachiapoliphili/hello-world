# hello-world

This is my hello world message. It's the first, and no one can ever know but I need to know so here goes.
It's the first, and no one can ever know but I need to know so here goes. 
How am I supposed to know what to do with this information? I don't. No one cares. 
I feel like I'm being pushed away; like there's some secret plot to make me leave. 
Will I? No one knows.
